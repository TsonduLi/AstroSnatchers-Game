# AstroSnatchers

AstroSnatchers is a thrilling, fast-paced game set in the depths of space. Players navigate a UFO to "rescue" stranded astronauts floating after a spacecraft collision. The game involves sliding the UFO horizontally to snatch as many astronauts as possible while avoiding unpredictable asteroid fragments.

## How to Play

1. **Coin Insertion**: Insert 2 coins within 3 seconds to activate the game. A red LED will flash to indicate coin detection. The game begins after a 3-second countdown.
2. **UFO Maneuvering**: Use the steering wheel to move the UFO left or right, dodging asteroids and capturing astronauts.
3. **Speed Control**: Control the conveyor speed by pushing the joystick forward; the resting state is stationary.
4. **LED Display**: Monitor the one-minute countdown and your score on the LED matrix. Inactivity for 20 seconds triggers a timeout and resets the game.
